üìÅ Internship Projects ‚Äì Prodigy InfoTech
During my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I worked on a series of hands-on web development projects to strengthen my front-end and JavaScript skills. Each project focused on building real-world, interactive applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a brief overview of the projects I developed:

‚úÖ 1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A web-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players can compete in real time. The game handles user clicks, tracks game state, checks for winning conditions, and displays the result dynamically.

‚úÖ 2. Stopwatch Application
An interactive stopwatch app with Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap Time functionalities. This project showcases time tracking logic using JavaScript and a clean, responsive UI using CSS.

‚úÖ 3. Weather App
A weather application that fetches real-time weather data using a weather API. It allows users to check weather conditions based on their current location or a custom input location, displaying temperature, humidity, and sky conditions.

‚úÖ 4. Interactive Navigation Menu
A fixed-position, responsive navigation bar that changes background or text color on scroll and hover. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, scroll event handling, and responsive design principles.

‚úÖ 5. Personal Portfolio Website
A fully responsive personal portfolio site featuring a Home page, About Me, Skills, and Projects section. It highlights my background, technical skills, education, and accomplishments as a web developer.
